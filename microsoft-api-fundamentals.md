Azure Resource Manager aka ARM, is the deployment and management layer for Azure resources.  
Azure Resource Graph aka ARG, is a query service layer that sits on top of ARM.  
"Azure Resource Manager enables you to deploy and manage the infrastructure for your Azure solutions. You organize related resources in resource groups, and deploy your resources with JSON templates."

## Concepts
- REST APIs: A REST API is an application programming interface (API) that follows the design principles of the REST architectural style. REST is short for representational state transfer, and is a set of rules and guidelines about how you should build a web API.
- OData Namespace: The Microsoft Graph API defines most of its resources, methods, and enumerations in the OData namespace, microsoft.graph, in the Microsoft Graph metadata. 
- Tokens: Tokens provide access to specific resources, which is defined by the 'scope' of the token.
