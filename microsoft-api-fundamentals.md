# Microsoft API Fundamentals

## Foundational Concepts
- REST APIs: A REST API is an application programming interface (API) that follows the design principles of the REST architectural style. REST is short for representational state transfer, and is a set of rules and guidelines about how you should build a web API.
- OData Namespace: The Microsoft Graph API defines most of its resources, methods, and enumerations in the OData namespace, microsoft.graph, in the Microsoft Graph metadata. 
- Tokens: Tokens provide access to specific resources, which is defined by the 'scope' of the token.
